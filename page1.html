				<p>Spring is one of the most awaited seasons in Japan. It only means... it is time for..*drum roll please!* <strong>花見 "Hanami" or Cherry Blossom Viewing!</strong> This article is about Hakodate City, Hokkaido. Feel free to add Hakodate to your itinerary in Japan! Ikimashou desu!</p>  

				<br>

				<h3><strong>Transportation</strong></h3><br>

				<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/hokkaido_Shinkansen.JPG" alt="Bullet Train"><br>

				<p>From Tokyo, you can travel by air, car - ferry and the newly added Bullet train line. The cheapest is by air and the price will depend on the season. For the Bullet train, it might costs around <strong>$200-$300 for one way trip</strong>. The Hokkaido Shinkansen (北海道新幹線 Hokkaidō Shinkansen) is a Japanese high-speed shinkansen rail line that links up with the Tōhoku Shinkansen in northern Aomori Prefecture in Honshu and continues on into the interior of Hokkaido through the undersea Seikan Tunnel. Construction started in May 2005, and the initial Shin-Aomori to Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto section opened on 26th of March 2016. Extension of the line to Sapporo is scheduled to open by March 2031. The line is operated by the Hokkaido Railway Company (JR Hokkaido).</p>

				<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/hokkaidoShinkansen2.JPG" alt="Bullet Train"><br>

				<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/hokkaidoShinkansen.jpg" alt="Bullet Train"><br>

				<p>By 2018, it is proposed to allow one Shinkansen service each day to travel at <strong>260 km/h (160 mph)</strong> (the maximum speed proposed for the tunnel) by ensuring no freight trains are scheduled to travel on the dual-gauge section at that time.</p><br>

				<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/tram.jpg" alt="Tram"><br>

				<p>Once you arrived in Hakodate, you can explore the city via taxi, Rent-a-car (make sure you are legal to drive in Japan) near the airport. The common transportation systems are tram, express train and buses.</p>

				<h3><strong>Let's Checkout..</strong></h3><br>

				<h4>GORYOUKAKU PARK AND TOWER</h4><br>

				<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/goryoukaku.jpg" alt="Goryoukaku Fort"><br>

				<p>Goryōkaku (五稜郭) is a star fort in the Japanese city of Hakodate on the island of Hokkaido. It was the main fortress of the short-lived Republic of Ezo.</p>

				<p>Goryōkaku was designed in 1855 by Takeda Ayasaburō. His plan was based on the work of the French architect Vauban. It is shaped like a five-pointed star. This allowed for greater numbers of gun emplacements on its walls than a traditional Japanese fortress, and reduced the number of blind spots where a cannon could not fire.</p>

				<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/goryoukakuWinter.JPG" alt="Goryoukaku Fort"><br>

				<p>The fort was built by the Tokugawa shogunate to protect the Tsugaru Strait against a possible invasion by the Russian fleet.</p>

				<p>Goryōkaku is famous as the site of the last battle of the Boshin War. The fighting lasted for a week (June 20–27, 1869).</p>

				<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/goryoukakuTower.JPG" alt="Goryoukaku Tower"><br>

				<p>Today, Goryōkaku is a park. It has been declared a Special Historical Site and is home to the Hakodate city museum. The grounds are favorite spots for cherry-blossom viewing in spring.</p>

				<ul><strong>Admission fee of Goryoukaku Observatory Tower: (Group - 30 or more)</strong>
					<li>Adult ¥900 (¥810)</li>

				<h4>MOUNT HAKODATE</h4><br>

				<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/hakodateNight.jpg" alt="Mount Hakodate"><br>

				<p>The mountain is renowned for its view of the surrounding bay and city. The Michelin Green Guide: Japan gave the experience 3/3 stars in a review, placing it as equal to mountain views of Naples and Hong Kong. The peak is accessible by hiking or by bike, as well as by a regular cable car service.</p>

				<p>The Mt. Hakodate Ropeway (函館山ロープウェイ Hakodate Yama Rōpuwei) is the name of an aerial lift, as well as its operator. As of 2004, this is the most heavily used aerial lift line in Japan, transporting 1,559,000 riders yearly. The aerial tramway was prominently featured in Noein, a 2005 anime.

				Cabins operate once every 10 minutes. The whole ride takes 3 minutes. <strong>The fare costs around ¥780 one-way or ¥1280 for a round-trip.</strong></p><br>

				<h3><strong>Foodtrip at..</strong></h3>
				<!--INSERT RESTAURANT PICS HERE -->
				<h4>LUCKY PIERROT</h4><br>

				<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/luckyPierrot.JPG" alt="Restaurant"><br>

				<p>After you visit Goryoukaku Park and Tower, you can enjoy a nice meal at Lucky Pierrot. It is adjacent to Goryoukaku Park. The ambiance is quite like an old house of a Disney character. There are many life and over-sized figurines (mostly angels). There are big mirrors on the wall and the lights were golden plated.</p><br>

				<img class="img-responsive" src="assets/curry.JPG" alt="Curry"><br>

				<p>We ordered Ebi (Shrimp) and Hamburger curry. Our bill only costs ¥1500. Japanese restaurants offer big servings so it is worth it. It was very sumptuous and delicious. It was quite popular so expect some people there (mostly students) since they also offer desserts.</p>

				<h3><strong>So Where to Sleep?</strong></h3>

				<p>I booked for one night only since we will be traveling the next day to Otaru City. I recommend <strong>Hotel Go! Hakodate</strong> for a comfortable and affordable rooms. Their single room only costs around ¥4500 a night and that includes breakfast for one. You can book their rooms through Booking.com app and website.</p><br>

				<h3><strong>Friendly Reminders!</strong></h3>

					<ol>
						<li>Search for the place ahead of time. Download the maps or mark them. Google map can provide the precise schedules of trains in Japan.</li>
						<li>Book your hotels at least 2 months before your arrival. Be aware of the holidays in Japan. Expect higher price during Winter Break and Cherry Blossom Viewing season.</li>
						<li>Travel light as much as possible.</li>
						<li>Study their culture and follow the rules. Example, if you are in a train, observe silence :).</li>
						<li>Make sure you are gear for the season. Hokkaido is the coldest main island in Japan.</li>
						<li>Most tourists spots are seasonal. They are not available throughout the whole year so always check the websites of the places you want to visit.</li>
						<li>Try to interact with the locals. Make your adventure memorable! </li>
					</ol>
